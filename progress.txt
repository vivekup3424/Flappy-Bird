I am going to code this in OOPS-approach,
hence I need to make different classes for each of the above mentioned tasks.

1. Bird
2. Pipe - PipeTop and PipeBottom
3. Ground

After this in later section of the I am going
-generate many bird at the same time , and have them all move around based on their
own rules of the Neural Networks
-Create a population of birds, and have them all learn to play the game at the same time.
